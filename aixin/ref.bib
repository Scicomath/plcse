abstract = {We compute the electromagnetic fields generated in heavy-ion collisions by using the HIJING model. Although after averaging over many events only the magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction plane is sizable, we find very strong magnetic and electric fields both parallel and perpendicular to the reaction plane on the event-by-event basis. We study the time evolution and the spatial distribution of these fields. Especially, the electromagnetic response of the quark-gluon plasma can give non-trivial evolution of the electromagnetic fields. The implications of the strong electromagnetic fields on the hadronic observables are also discussed.},

@article{Kharzeev2008,
abstract = {Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) contains field configurations which can be characterized by a topological invariant, the winding number Qw. Configurations with non-zero Qw break the charge-parity (CP) symmetry of QCD. We consider a novel mechanism by which these configurations can separate charge in the presence of a background magnetic field-the "chiral magnetic effect". We argue that sufficiently large magnetic fields are created in heavy ion collisions so that the chiral magnetic effect causes preferential emission of charged particles along the direction of angular momentum. Since separation of charge is CP-odd, any observation of the chiral magnetic effect could provide a clear demonstration of the topological nature of the QCD vacuum. We give an estimate of the effect and conclude that it might be observed experimentally. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
